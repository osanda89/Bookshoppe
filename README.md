Bookshoppe
==========

This project is followed the concept of the E-commerce thoroughly. This
project is developed to sell the products on line of various book collection
category mentioned in the project. This project denitely helps the user to
purchase books from the internet because in the ONLINE BOOK SHOP you
can purchase anything with clicking of the some buttons and entering your
credit card no or any other online payments methods like PayPal or master,
visa cards.

This web project is dedicated to deliver a specic need for people who
are interested in books. We have noticed that though there are online book-
stores for popular publishers like GODAGE and M.D. GUNASENA and it
is dicult to nd a good place to sell books for independent book publishers
and authors who are not popular, but publish quality books. So they are
limited to selling their books in a small area unless a bigger publisher notice
their product and we are planning to address this issue in this project.

The other fact we try to address by our project is the fact that there are
almost no website which allows independent book collectors and small scale
library owners to exhibit their collections. In our site we not only allow this
function but we also allow them to get in contact with each other to request
trades or even lending them for private use, though we do not plan on taking
responsibility for those type of exchanges and transport of that type.
